robust CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins for my Java-based application! 🛠️ The pipeline leverages a powerful stack of tools to automate the entire deployment process.

## 🔧 Tools in Action:
-GitHub: Hosting the source code repository.
-Jenkins: Orchestrating the entire CI/CD pipeline.
-Maven: Building and managing dependencies.
-SonarQube: Ensuring code quality with static code analysis.
-Docker: Containerizing the application for consistency.
-Docker Hub: Securely storing and managing Docker images.
-Argo CD: Automating and managing Kubernetes deployments.
-Helm: Streamlining Kubernetes application deployment.
-Kubernetes: Orchestrating containerized applications.

## 🔍 Pipeline Stages:
-Checkout: Pulling the latest source code.
-Build and Test: Ensuring code integrity.
-Static Code Analysis: Leveraging SonarQube for quality checks.
-Build and Push Docker Image: Containerizing the application.
-Update Deployment File: Automating Kubernetes deployments with Argo CD and Helm.

📊 The journey involves integrating Docker Hub for image storage and employing Argo CD for automated updates to the Kubernetes cluster.
